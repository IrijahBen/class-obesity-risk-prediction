BMI Prediction using Machine Learning
Welcome to the BMI Prediction project! This repository is dedicated to exploring the exciting realm of Body Mass Index (BMI) prediction using machine learning techniques. Predicting BMI not only offers valuable insights into an individual's health status but also serves as a stepping stone towards personalized healthcare interventions.

Overview
Objective: Develop a robust machine learning model to predict BMI classes based on diverse health data.

Data Source: The project utilizes datasets from the Kaggle Playground Series (Season 4, Episode 2). You can find the competition details here.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the datasets used for training and testing the BMI prediction model.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks documenting the data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation steps.

src/: Python scripts for modularized code used in the project.
